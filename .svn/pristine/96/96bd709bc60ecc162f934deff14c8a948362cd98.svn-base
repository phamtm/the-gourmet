Meanwhile, sit the chicken breasts on a board and cut through them horizontally leaving one side attached. Open them up like a book and lay a basil leaf on top of each, topped with a slice of prosciutto. Secure with a cocktail stick.
Heat the oil in a large, non-stick frying pan and add the chicken breasts, hamside down. Cook for 2-3 mins until golden, then turn over and cook for 2 mins more. Pour over the Marsala and allow to bubble for 1 min. Add the stock and simmer for 5 mins until the chicken is cooked. Lift the chicken out, cover to keep warm, then boil the pan juices to reduce a little. Serve with the basil mash and a green salad on the side, if you like.');

values('Easy tomato pizzas','52.jpg','For the dough, put the flour, yeast and 2 tsp salt into a large bowl and mix. Make a well. Mix the oil and water in a jug, then tip into the bowl. Use a wooden spoon to work the liquid into the flour - it will seem pretty wet. Set the bowl aside for 15 mins. Leaving the dough like this will save you from lengthy kneading later.
Turn the dough onto a well-floured surface, flour your hands, then knead it very gently for about 2 mins until it is fairly even, soft and bouncy. Return the dough to the bowl, cover with oiled cling film, then let it rise in a warm place (or in the fridge overnight) until doubled in size.
When ready to cook, heat oven to 240C/220C fan/gas 9 or as hot as it will go, then put a baking sheet in on a high shelf. Dust another sheet with flour. Split the dough into 8, then roll 3 balls thinly into rough circles. Lift onto the floured sheet. Smear over a thin layer of the sauce, scatter over a few slices of tomato, season, then add sliced goat\'s or grated Parmesan cheese if you want to. Slide the sheet on top of the heated sheet. Bake for 12 mins or until golden and crisp and the tomatoes are starting to caramelise around the edges. Top with any fresh toppings, then drizzle with more olive oil to serve.');
